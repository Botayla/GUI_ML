ü§ñ Machine Learning Web App

Welcome to the Machine Learning Web App, a fully interactive tool for exploring, preprocessing, visualizing, and modeling datasets using popular machine learning techniques ‚Äî all through a sleek web interface built with Streamlit.

This project is perfect for data enthusiasts, students, and professionals who want to quickly experiment with different ML workflows without writing repetitive boilerplate code.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
1. Data Upload & Overview

Upload your CSV dataset directly through the web interface.

Preview the first few rows of your dataset.

View dataset info, including column types, null counts, and basic statistics.

Display a statistical summary of numerical columns.

Display a summary of categorical columns.

2. Data Visualization

Interactive histograms and boxplots for selected columns.

Count plots for categorical features.

Correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between numerical features.

3. Preprocessing Tools

Column Management: Drop unnecessary columns.

Missing Value Handling: Apply mean, median, or most frequent imputation.

Outlier Handling: Options include IQR, Z-score filtering, or log transformation.

Encoding:

  -  One-Hot Encoding
  
  - Label Encoding
  
  - Ordinal Encoding

Scaling:

 - MinMaxScaler
  
 - StandardScaler
  
 - RobustScaler
